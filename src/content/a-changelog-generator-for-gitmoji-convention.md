## gitmoji

It is a commit message convention created by [Carlos Cuesta](https://twitter.com/crloscuesta) 😎. It describes the purpose of this convention on gitmoji's [repository](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji/) on GitHub:

> Gitmoji is an initiative to standardize and explain the use of emojis on GitHub commit messages.

> Using emojis on commit messages provides an easy way of identifying the purpose or intention of a commit with only looking at the emojis used. As there are a lot of different emojis I found the need of creating a guide that can help to use emojis easier.

## gitmoji-changelog

With [Benjamin Petetot](https://twitter.com/bpetetot) and [Fabien Juif](https://twitter.com/fabienjuif) we worked on a command line tool that generates changelog files for javascript projects following gitmoji convention. We simply named it `gitmoji-changelog` 😀.

Here is an example of [generated changelog](https://github.com/bpetetot/conference-hall/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) using `gitmoji-changelog`
