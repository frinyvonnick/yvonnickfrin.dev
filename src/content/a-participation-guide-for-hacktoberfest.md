Hacktoberfest starts today üéâ

This is a month-long celebration of open source software. To participate you need to open four pull requests between October 1 and October 31. If you do that you all receive stickers and a limited edition t-shirt for that year's celebration. Only the first 50,000 first participants will earn a t-shirt.

## How to participate

First of all you need to sign in on the event's website:

https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/

You can now start contributing on GitHub! It takes in account all PRs made on public repositories.

## I'm new to open source, how can I contribute?

[Benjamin Petetot](https://twitter.com/bpetetot) wrote an [article](https://dev.to/bpetetot/getting-started-in-open-source-2pf2) about "Getting started" in open source. It explains how the open source world works. There are also pointers to website that lists repositories waiting for contributions.

Digital ocean have made [guides](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/an-introduction-to-open-source) about the technical aspect of making a contribution. There are ressources about `git` and the `pull request` mechanism.

## I'm an open source maintainer, how do I participate?

You should make your repository friendly to new comers. I wrote an [article](https://dev.to/yvonnickfrin/preparing-your-project-being-open-sourced-5bdp) to help you to prepare your project in order to get its first contributions.

Hackotberfest's website lists all repositories having issues labelled by `Hacktoberfest`. Feel free to add this label to issues that are easy to fix like your project's `good first issues`.

You can promote your project during the month to grab a few contributors. [Thomas Betous](https://twitter.com/tbetous) and [Franck Abgrall](https://twitter.com/FranckAbgrall) have made a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/zenika-open-source/open-source-promotion-cheat-sheet/#readme) to help you on this subject. It is available in english and french.

This year Dev.to is one of the sponsor and the platform wrote an [article](https://dev.to/devteam/hacktoberfest-starts-in-six-days-3hi2) about how to use the website during the event as a participant or a maintainer.

Have a nice Hacktoberfest üôå and don't forget to share your pull-requests here ‚ù§Ô∏è
