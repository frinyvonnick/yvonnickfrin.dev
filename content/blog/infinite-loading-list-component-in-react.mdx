Hi üëã,

Last week I wrote an article about [creating an infinite loading list with React and GraphQL](https://dev.to/yvonnickfrin/create-an-infinite-loading-list-with-react-and-graphql-19hh). I figured out it was possible to write an abstraction for this particular case.

I introduce you [react-simple-infinite-loading](https://github.com/frinyvonnick/react-simple-infinite-loading). It displays a list elements that load as the user scrolls down the list.

![An infinite loading list of persons](https://github.com/frinyvonnick/create-infinite-loading-list-react-graphql/blob/master/assets/infinite_loading.gif?raw=true)

Here is an example of code. You can find a more concrete example in the [repository](https://github.com/frinyvonnick/create-infinite-loading-list-react-graphql/blob/master/src/InfiniteList.js) of my [previous article](https://dev.to/yvonnickfrin/create-an-infinite-loading-list-with-react-and-graphql-19hh) using a GraphQL server.

```jsx
import React from 'react'

import InfiniteLoadingList from 'react-simple-infinite-loading'

function Example ({ items, fetchMore, hasMore }) {
  return (
    <div style={{ width: 300, height: 300 }}>
      <InfiniteLoading
        items={items}
        itemHeight={40}
        hasMoreItems={hasMore}
        loadMoreItems={fetchMore}
      >
        {({ item, style }) => (
          <div style={style}>{item}</div>
        )}
      </InfiniteLoading>
    </div>
  )
}
```

It uses three libraries from [Brian Vaughn](https://github.com/bvaughn):

- [react-window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window) is made to display efficiently large lists. It only creates components for the visible elements and reuse nodes.
- [react-window-infinite-loader](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window-infinite-loader/) is a HOC that loads elements just-in-time as user scrolls down the list
- [react-virtualized-auto-sizer](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized-auto-sizer/) helps you displaying your list so it fits the space available in its parent container.

If you are interested feel free to give it a try!
