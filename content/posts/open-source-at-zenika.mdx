A few weeks ago we announced the launch of our brand new [website](https://oss.zenika.com) at [Zenika](https://www.zenika.com/) about our open source culture. It aims to promote our projects and those of our colleagues.

Here is a few of these:

- [immutadot](https://github.com/zenika-open-source/immutadot) is a JavaScript library to deal with nested immutable structures.
- [bento-starter](https://github.com/kefranabg/bento-starter) is full-stack solution to quickly build PWA applications with Vue.js and Firebase.
- [Emendare](https://github.com/jimmyleray/Emendare) is a democratic platform to draft amendable texts.

You can find more projects on our [GitHub's organization](https://github.com/zenika-open-source) or on our [website](https://oss.zenika.com).

We also wrote an article on how to [get started in open source](https://oss.zenika.com/white-paper/getting-started). This is a first of six articles on the world of open source.
