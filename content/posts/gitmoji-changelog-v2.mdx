[gitmoji-changelog](https://github.com/frinyvonnick/gitmoji-changelog) is a command line tool that generates changelog files for projects following gitmoji convention.

Last week, I published the version 2.0.0 🔖

There was two major goals in this version: 

- Making the cli available for all kinds of projects not only JavaScript ones
- Add tests to be more confident about merging contributions

## 🏗 Preset system

To enable the cli for more users than the JavaScript ones ❤️ we needed find another way to gather projects metadata like name, version and description than we did in first version. Previously, we get these from the first `package.json` file we found in the upper folder hierarchy. We extracted this logic from our `core` package and imagine a simple system to make the cli more flexible. [Benjamin Petetot](https://github.com/bpetetot) proposed a preset system describe in this [issue](https://github.com/frinyvonnick/gitmoji-changelog/issues/85).

The usage is quite simple you have to call the cli with preset option filled with the preset you want to use:

```sh
gitmoji-changelog --preset=node
```

We only wrote the preset for node right now. We need you to help us identify which preset to develop. Please fill this [form](https://yvonnickfrin.typeform.com/to/eC5OLL) so we know the presets you want 🙌

We add [presets](https://github.com/frinyvonnick/gitmoji-changelog/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#presets) section in our documentation. It also contains a tutorial that explains how to write a new [preset](https://github.com/frinyvonnick/gitmoji-changelog/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md#add-a-preset). Feel free to open a pull request to add one that doesn't already exist 🙏

## ✅ E2E tests

To make the code base easier to refactored and simplify contributors work, We spend some time adding e2e tests. It was quite hard since we didn't find a simple solution to test a cli that interacts with the filesystem (if you know some library to do it tell us in comment section).

With these tests we are not afraid anymore to broke the cli each time we commit some changes 😂

There are two commands to execute tests now. One for unit tests:

```sh
yarn test
```

Another one for e2e tests:

```sh
yarn test:e2e
```
<br />

## ✨ Interactive mode

Special mention to [Franck Abgrall](https://github.com/kefranabg) who added a whole feature. Using the option `-i` let you enter in interactive mode:

```sh
gitmoji-changelog -i
```

In this mode you can pick which commits you want to add into your changelog for the current version.

## 💡 Documentation

Before releasing, we made some effort to improve the [documentation](https://github.com/frinyvonnick/gitmoji-changelog/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md). We put it into a separate file to keep our README.md as simple as possible. We did the same thing with the [contributing guide](https://github.com/frinyvonnick/gitmoji-changelog/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). The documentation now describes all available options in the cli. We also clarified how the cli works and the workflow we recommend using.

Don't hesitate to tell us if something isn't clear enough.

## ❤️ Thanks 

We only talked about presets and tests to keep it short but a lot of other things have been done in this version! Find more in our [changelog](https://github.com/frinyvonnick/gitmoji-changelog/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) 😉
