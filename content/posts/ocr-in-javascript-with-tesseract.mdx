While I making [node-html-to-image](https://github.com/frinyvonnick/node-html-to-image) I came across a small problem. How to test it actually works? `node-html-to-image` is a Node.js module that generates images (png, jpeg) from HTML. If you want to learn more about it I wrote a [small article](/node-html-to-image) about this module. The simplest test I could imagine to ensure it works was creating an image from an HTML string containing "Hello world!". Then I could check the image really contains this string using [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition).

## What is OCR?

OCR stands for optical character recognition. It is a technology that let you extract text from an image. It can be handrwritten or printed text. OCR involves a lot a complex steps to actually get text from an image but it isn't the prupose of this article. You can learn more reading its [wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition).

We will focus on how to use it with the most popular open source OCR engine, [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract). As a lib it is available for C/C++ developpers. Fortunately, it exists a port in JavaScript.

## Installation

`Tesseract.js` doesn't need you to install anything on your computer unlike [node-tesseract-ocr](https://github.com/zapolnoch/node-tesseract-ocr). It also means it doesn't work offline. `node-tesseract-orc` is only a wrapper around `tesseract` so you need to install `tesseract` and `tesseract-lang` on your computer. While `Tesseract.js` downloads languages and core scripts on the go.

The only thing you need to do is installing npm package `Tesseract.js` using your favorite package manager:

```sh
# With yarn
yarn add Tesseract.js
# With npm
npm install Tesseract.js
```

## How to use

Here is the image we will try to extract text from.

![An image with Hello world in it](/images/hello-world.png)

Let's go through it step by step.

First of all we need to import the `createWorker` function.

```js
const { createWorker } = require('tesseract.js')
```

We call it to create a new tesseract worker which is a Child Process in Node.js and a Web Worker in the browser (yes, Tesseract.js also work in the browser).  

```js
const worker = createWorker()
```

A worker instance have several methods. The first we need to call is the [load](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js/blob/master/docs/api.md#workerloadjobid-promise) function. It loads core scripts and prepare tesseract worker for what's coming next.

```js
// ...

async function getTextFromImage() {
  await worker.load()
}
```

Then, we need to load the language of the text in our image. We can achieve it with [loadLanguages](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js/blob/master/docs/api.md#workerloadlanguagelangs-jobid-promise) method. I will download a file with trained date for the language in it. In our example, it will be a file called `eng.traineddata`. We can load more than one language using `+` character (ex: `eng+fr`).

```js
// ...

async function getTextFromImage() {
  await worker.load()
  await worker.loadLanguage('eng')
}
```

Time to make our worker ready to do OCR tasks. We do it with the [initialize](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js/blob/master/docs/api.md#workerinitializelangs-oem-jobid-promise) method. It takes language we want to use as parameters. It can be a subset of the languages we loaded earlier.

```js
// ...

async function getTextFromImage() {
  await worker.load()
  await worker.loadLanguage('eng')
  await worker.initialize('eng')
}
```

Let's do OCR! Our worker has a [recognize](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js/blob/master/docs/api.md#workerrecognizeimage-options-jobid-promise) method that takes an image as parameter. It can be an url, a path on the file system or a buffer. It returns a object with a data property that also is an object with a text property in it containing the final result.

```js
// ...

async function getTextFromImage() {
  await worker.load()
  await worker.loadLanguage('eng')
  await worker.initialize('eng')

  const { data: { text } } = await worker.recognize('./hello-world.png');
}
```

Last step we need to clean up our worker using the method [terminate](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js/blob/master/docs/api.md#workerterminatejobid-promise).

```js
// ...

async function getTextFromImage() {
  await worker.load()
  await worker.loadLanguage('eng')
  await worker.initialize('eng')

  const { data: { text } } = await worker.recognize('./hello-world.png');

  await worker.terminate()
}
```

Let's test it! we call our function and print the result to the output.

```js
getTextFromImage()
  .then(console.log)
```

As you call your script you should get the following result.

```sh
~ ❯ node tesseract.js                                                                                                                                                   ⏎
HELLO WORLD!
```

Nice, but it didn't find all the text from our image... 

By default, Tesseract works in `SINGLE_BLOCK` mode. A worker instance has a [setParameters](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js/blob/master/docs/api.md#workersetparametersparams-jobid-promise) that let you change Tesseract default behavior. In our case we want to change the `tessedit_pageseg_mode` parameter value. Before doing it we need to import the PSM enumeration (this is an acronym for page segmentation mode).

```js
const { createWorker } = require('tesseract.js')
const PSM = require('tesseract.js/src/constants/PSM.js')

// ...
```

Finally, we call `setParameters` method with the wanted mode. For the example, we will use `AUTO` mode and let the engine find all lines.

```js
const { createWorker } = require('tesseract.js')
const PSM = require('tesseract.js/src/constants/PSM.js')

async function getTextFromImage() {
  await worker.load()
  await worker.loadLanguage('eng')
  await worker.initialize('eng')
  await worker.setParameters({
    tessedit_pageseg_mode: PSM.AUTO,
  })

  const { data: { text } } = await worker.recognize('./hello-world.png');

  await worker.terminate()
}
```

By calling your should get a different result.

```sh
~ ❯ node tesseract.js                                                                                                                                                   ⏎
HELLO WORLD!

```

As you can see it find the whole text. It seems to have difficulties to identify the emoji character but it is a pretty impressive result.

There are a lot more [examples](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js/blob/master/docs/examples.md) in Tesseract.js documentation with extra features like:

- progress
- multi languages
- whitelist char
- And more...

You're set 🙌 Hope it will help you!
